            <hr>
            <p>I have had interest in learning how to code for a while but felt I could learn by myself. But withh recent happeenings and all, I just had to admit to needing a structure I could rely on. I had been seeing altschool pop up on my timeline every now and then, so the idea was totally strange to me. It was my friend who finally prompted me to apply especially because there was the opportunity for a discount.
            
            I think Altschool is a place of excellence and they have quite a track record that proves that. Thhey also boast of well-versed tutors across the industry. Also, I think thhe testimonies of the students who have passed through Altschool has been outstanding. All these fueled my resolve to register and identify with Altschool.  I hope to have a smooth ride through my time here!

            <p>It's quite simple. I'm on the frontend path and I just want to learn the languages and technologies peculiar to my path, become very good at them. Then, land a well-paying internship where I can further polish my skills. </p>
